# 42HN_fract_lol
Summary:

This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.

Foreword:

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale.
